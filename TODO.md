# TODO

- operators:

  - zipCmp (after state machine)

- utils: make firstOf work with any monad

- unions
  - merge tag and union or remove both
  - errables vs either
- safeAssert

- tests (improve coverage)

- merge to utils

- pick/multi

## Next

- state machines
- optics

## Later

- group et cie, add fold argument

## Maybe

- async iterator

## Blocked

- merge nothing.void() to nothing.of()
- when scan is called with a fold having an init, it should immediately call next, but we cannot do that beacause of index
