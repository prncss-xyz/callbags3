# TODO

- context

- tests (improve coverage)

- merge to utils

- state machine exemples
    - undo/redo
    - games
    - wordCOunt
    - zipCmp

- pick/multi

## Next

- optics

## Later

- group et cie, add fold argument
- unions
  - merge tag and union or remove both

## Maybe

- value -> payload
- async iterator
- machine: default

## Blocked

- merge nothing.void() to nothing.of()
- when scan is called with a fold having an init, it should immediately call next, but we cannot do that beacause of index
